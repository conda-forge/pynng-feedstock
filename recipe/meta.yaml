  summary: Python bindings for Nanomsg Next Generation.
  description: |
    Ergonomic bindings for nanomsg next generation (nng), in Python. pynng
    provides a nice interface on top of the full power of nng. nng, and
    therefore pynng, make it easy to communicate between processes on a
    single computer or computers across a network. This library is
    compatible with Python â‰¥ 3.5. nng is the rewriting of Nanomsg, which
    is the spiritual successor to ZeroMQ.
